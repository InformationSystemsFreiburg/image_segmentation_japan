## [2.0.9] - not released yet
 * fast annotation mode @todo
    - keyboard input '123' denotes the following operation: select region 1, set 3 as the value of region attribute 2.
    - if there is a single region attribute, the '13' sets 3 as the value of region 1
    - if there are more than 9 regions, '1223' applies operation '23' to region '12'
    - '0' is reserved to set the file attribute
    - '023' assigns value 3 to the file attribute 2
    - provide visual cues to the user when doing these operations (update bottom status bar as keys are pressed)
 * image grid view
    - cancel ongoing image load process
    - add a "UNASSIGNED" group to denote all the files that do not have a value for the group variable
    - preload images in adjacent groups to speed up visualization
    - label subgroup of images in a group based on a certain variable
